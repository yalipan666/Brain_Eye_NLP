# Brain_Eye_NLP

This repository contains the code for the "Brain_Eye_NLP" project, which investigates the integration of the human attention mechanism—measured through eye movements and brain activity (MEG)—into the attention mechanism used in natural language processing (NLP) when reading sentences.


## Folder Structure

- `Codes/`: Python scripts for data analysis and visualisation
- `Data/`: Local folder containing large `.h5` MEG data files (excluded from GitHub)
- `README.md`: This file
- Project description.docx`: a more detailed description of the current project, including the structure of the human eye movments and brain data. 

## How to Run the Code

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yalipan666/Brain_Eye_NLP.git
    cd Brain_Eye_NLP/Codes
    ```

2. Install required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the main script:
    ```bash
    python script_name.py
